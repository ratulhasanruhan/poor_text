# 💸 poor_text

**_Text rendering for the broke and the bold._**

`poor_text` is a Flutter widget that parodies `RichText`. It's the best worst way to render text in your app.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧑‍🎨 **No rich styling**: You get what you pay for.
- 🎨 **Greyscale color by default**: Color is a premium.
- 🔤 **Random Google Fonts**: We use the "forgotten" fonts.
- 🕰 **Laggy rendering**: For that slow, nostalgic effect.
- 🪛 **Auto-shrink text**: The longer your string, the tinier it becomes.
- 📄 **Pretend rich text**: HTML tags get stripped and mocked.
- 🧃 **Fake PoorTextRich**: Styled spans... except they're not.
